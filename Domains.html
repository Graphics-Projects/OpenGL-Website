     <h2>
          OpenGL is used in a lot of different domains in computer science. Here are some domains that uses OpenGL:
     </h2>
     <h2>1. Video Game Development
          3D Games: OpenGL is used to create immersive environments, realistic lighting, and animations.
          2D Games: For rendering sprites and effects in 2D space.
          Cross-Platform Development: Ideal for games targeting multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.</h2>
     <h2>2. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
          Simulations: Used to render real-time 3D scenes for VR applications.
          Interactive AR Experiences: For overlaying virtual objects in real-world environments.
          </h2>
     <h2>3. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Engineering
          Architecture and Engineering: For visualizing designs and creating complex 3D models.
          Simulations: Used in physics simulations and prototyping tools.
          </h2>
     <h2>4. Scientific Visualization
          Medical Imaging: For rendering 3D models of anatomical structures or CT/MRI scans.
          Data Visualization: In scientific research to create 2D/3D plots and simulations of large datasets.</h2>
     <h2>5. Education and Training
          Learning Tools: Interactive visualizations in physics, chemistry, and other sciences.
          Flight Simulators: Used to create realistic training environments for pilots.</h2>

     <h2>6. Media and Entertainment
          Animation: Rendering 3D animations and effects in movies and TV.
          Interactive Installations: For museums, theme parks, or art exhibits.</h2>
     <h2>7. Automotive and Aerospace Industries
          Simulation Software: For testing and visualizing mechanical designs.
          HUDs (Head-Up Displays): For real-time rendering of graphical overlays in vehicles.</h2>
     <img src="assets/aerospace industries.jpeg" alt="">
          <h2>8. Web Graphics
          Through technologies like WebGL, a JavaScript API that brings OpenGL functionality to web browsers, allowing developers to create rich graphics content directly in the browser.</h2>
     <img src="assets/webgl.jpeg" alt="">
          <h2>9. Robotics
          Simulation and Path Planning: For visualizing robot movement and environments.
          SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): Real-time rendering for navigation and obstacle avoidance.</h2>
     <h2>10. AI and Machine Learning
          Visualization of Neural Networks: To understand model architectures and training processes.
          Simulated Environments: For training AI models in virtual worlds (e.g., reinforcement learning).
          </h2>
